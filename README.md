# Complete Database Replication Project

<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>

This project demonstrates the distribution of a database using complete replication. It ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability by maintaining synchronized copies of the database across multiple servers. The goal is to replicate data from a master database (source) to one or more replica databases, keeping them in real-time sync.
